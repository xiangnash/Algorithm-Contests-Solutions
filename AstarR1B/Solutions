Problem description: http://www.baiduer.com.cn/2012-06/28158.html 


=== Solutions(without problem D) ===

problem A: (Gaussian elimination)
	1. get binary base with Gaussian elimination method
	2. construct the largest and the second largest number with bases

problem B:(simple dynamic programming)
	f[i][j]: send out j presents of type A to the first i friends, i.e. (i-j) presents of type B
	f[i][j] = max{f[i-1][j] + present[i].w1, f[i-1][j-1] + present[i].w0}

problem C: (Disjoint set)
	1. get all the similarity distances
	2. enumerate distances from the smallest to largest, and combine all the points smaller than current distance to one cluster
	3. repeat step 2 until the number of clusters/sets smaller than k
